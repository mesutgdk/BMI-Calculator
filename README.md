#  BMI Calculator

*  I just wanted to create an easy-to-use app that can calculate body mass index and designed with MVC design pattern.

## What I have learned and discovered

* MVC design pattern
* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
